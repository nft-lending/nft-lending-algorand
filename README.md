# NFT Lending Auction

NFT Lending Auction allows the owners of NFTs to obtain collateralized loans. The lenders compete in an auction for best repayment terms. The winning lender gets to provide the loan.

The back end is using only the Algorand blockchain, and as such it does not need a separate installation. For each auction and resulting loan, a new Algorand smart contract is deployed. The contract is deleted by either cancelling the auction, repayment of the loan or liquidation.

The front end can be deployed as static content, prefferrably on IPFS, in order to avoid content modification hacks. Once served, it is running JavaScript code in the browser using React.js and the Algorand JavaScript API. It uses the MyAlgo Connect Wallet in order to sign the transactions.
